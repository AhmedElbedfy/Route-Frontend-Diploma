                As a part ofastronomy, astrophysics dealc with the
                study of celestial bodies by applying the laws of
                physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of
                different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
                physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book
                unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics,
                which will be crucial for the holistic understanding
                of the subject matter.
